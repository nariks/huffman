# 🚀 Huffman Compression Engine
A high-performance C implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for lossless data compression.

## 📁 Project Structure
* src/     - Core implementation logic (.c files)
* include/ - Public headers and data structures (.h files)
* bin/     - Compiled executables (generated by Makefile)
* tests/   - Sample files for compression testing

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
* make build automation tool

### Compilation
To build the project with strict error checking (-Wall -Wextra -Werror), run the following in your terminal:

$ make

### Usage (Phase 1)
To perform frequency analysis on a target file, use the generated stats binary:

$ ./bin/huffman_stats <path_to_file>

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Phase 1: Environment Setup & Frequency Analysis (Current)
- [ ] Phase 2: Huffman Tree Construction
- [ ] Phase 3: Encoding & Bit-Packing
- [ ] Phase 4: Header Design & Decoding

## 👨‍💻 Development Standards
* Branching: All work for the current phase must be done on a feature branch (e.g., phase-1-analysis).
* Commits: Use descriptive, imperative commit messages (e.g., "feat: implement buffered file reading").
* Memory: All allocated memory must be freed. Code will be audited using Valgrind.

## 🧪 Testing
We are using Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" as our primary benchmark for Phase 1. 

To run the stress test:
$ ./bin/huffman_stats tests/les_miserables.txt

Your implementation should handle the ~3.3MB file instantly.
